release 5 and up
## ‚öôÔ∏è release 5+ new Commands Overview
Explanation Toggle (/explain)
This command gives the user control over an "English Explanation" section in the AI's output.

Default Behavior: The explanation section is on (shown).

Turning Off: Typing /explain=0 hides the explanation for a cleaner, more concise output.

Turning On: Typing /explain=1 re-enables the explanation section.

System Version (/version)
This is a simple informational command used to check the AI's current operational status.

Function: When the user types /version, the AI reports its current software or update file.

Purpose: It allows users or developers to confirm exactly which version of the system is running.

Example Output: The rule provides the specific format: "Currently running on 'Release 5' (release-V5.txt)".

Reset Language (/resetlang)
This command is for managing the language setting the user may have previously chosen.

Function: Typing /resetlang clears the currently active language that was set by a previous command (like /lang4 to).

Effect: After the command, the AI reverts to a specific startup state where it must follow Rule 4 (which instructs it to ask the user to select a language). It essentially removes the saved language preference.
